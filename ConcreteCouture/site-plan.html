			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>The homepage will include a large hero section, featuring an image of the newest trend in streetwear and high fashion. A short title such as "Nigo's newest collaboration will shock you" will help captivate a first time user of the site.
                I want to also include an interactive button that will suggest to users to learn more, then will transport them to the article under the "blog" section. I will also include a subheading with the most recent articles and trends that are featured on my site.
                I will also include a footer with all social media platforms and links that take users to those sites.
            </p>
			<h3>Shop</h3>
			<p>The shop page will also include a large hero section, displaying all the newest and trending items. I will also include links to these items that will take users to the original site of the item.
                I will also include a sorting feature that will allow users to filter the items they are most interested in.
            </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p></p>
			<img src="HomePageWirefram.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Shop</h3>
			<p></p>
			<img src="ShopWireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
